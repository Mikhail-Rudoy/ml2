The following is what we were supposed to keep track of:<br />
<ol>
	<li>How did you search? (I didn't)</li>
	<li>What did you find? (Nothing... see 1)</li>
	<li>What were some useless resources you found? (None... see 1)</li>
	<li>What were some good resources you found? (None... see 1)</li>
</ol>
<table border="1">
	<tr>
		<td width="200" style="text-align:center;font-size:24">This</td>
		<td width="200" style="text-align:center;font-size:24">is</td>
		<td width="200" style="text-align:center;font-size:24">a</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td width="200" style="text-align:center;font-size:24">copyright infringing</td>
		<td width="200" style="text-align:center;font-size:24">table</td>
		<td width="200" style="text-align:center;font-size:24"><img src="http://www.digsdigs.com/photos/Cool-Kids-Table-Chalkboard-Table-by-Eric-Pfeiffer-1-554x554.jpg" alt="You didn't show alt text, so I just assumed you had some." width="200" height="200" /></td>
